# AdaBoostClassifier with DecisionTreeClassifier
## Overview
This README provides information on how to use the AdaBoostClassifier from scikit-learn library with DecisionTreeClassifier as the base estimator. The AdaBoost algorithm is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple weak learners (base estimators) to create a stronger predictive model.

## Further Customization
You can further customize the AdaBoostClassifier by modifying the parameters and using different base estimators. For example, you can try different values for n_estimators, learning_rate, or change the base_estimator to other classifiers like RandomForestClassifier or SVC.

## Conclusion
Using the AdaBoostClassifier with DecisionTreeClassifier as the base estimator can be a powerful technique for solving classification problems. It combines multiple weak learners to create a stronger predictive model. By following the steps outlined in this README, you can easily implement and customize the AdaBoost algorithm for your own datasets.
